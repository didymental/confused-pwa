## Overview

Confused is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help students give instructors real time feedback. It is traditionally uneasy for shy students to raise a concern publically in a big classroom, so Confused is here to help reduce the mental barriers for students to say "I'm confused" during lessons.

On our app, instructors could create, start and share sessions using session code or QR code. They could easily keep track of students' reactions and questions in a session.

Whenever students feel confused during a session, they could simply tap the reaction "I'm confused" to give instrutors instantaneously feedback. They are also encouraged to send questions to give instructors more hints of what they are confused about!
